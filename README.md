# My Cursor Project

This is **My Cursor**, a smart developer assistant project that leverages OpenAI's API to automate code and file generation tasks. The project includes a Node.js backend that interacts with OpenAI, as well as several sample web applications generated by the assistant.

## Features

-   **AI-Powered Developer Assistant:**  
    Uses OpenAI's GPT models to process user queries and generate code, files, and shell commands.
-   **Tool Integration:**  
    Built-in tools for weather info, shell command execution, and file creation.
-   **Sample Applications:**  
    Example web apps (Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, Stopwatch, Todo App) generated by the assistant to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Project Structure

```
.env
index.js
package.json
pnpm-lock.yaml
tic_tac_toe.py
rock-paper-scissor/
  index.html
  style.css
stopwatch app/
  index.html
  script.js
  style.css
tic-tac-toe/
  index.html
  script.js
  style.css
  styles.css
todo app/
  index.html
  script.js
  styles.css
```

-   **index.js**: Main Node.js entry point. Handles user queries, interacts with OpenAI, and manages tool actions.
-   **tic_tac_toe.py**: Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe with AI.
-   **rock-paper-scissor/**: Web app for Rock Paper Scissors (HTML/CSS).
-   **stopwatch app/**: Web app for a stopwatch and task manager.
-   **tic-tac-toe/**: Advanced Tic Tac Toe web app (HTML/CSS/JS).
-   **todo app/**: Simple Todo web app (HTML/CSS/JS).
-   **.env**: Stores your OpenAI API key.

## How It Works

1. **User Query:**  
   You provide a query (e.g., "Create a Tic Tac Toe game in JS").
2. **AI Reasoning:**  
   The assistant thinks step-by-step, chooses tools, and generates code or files as needed.
3. **Sample Generation:**  
   Example apps in the folders above were created by the assistant in response to such queries.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
2. **Set your OpenAI API key:**  
   Add your key to the `.env` file.
3. **Run the assistant:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
4. **Open the generated sample apps:**  
   Open the HTML files in your browser from the respective folders.
